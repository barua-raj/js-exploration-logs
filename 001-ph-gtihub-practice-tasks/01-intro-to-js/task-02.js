// Task-2
    // Write a program to calculate the average marks of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Bangla of a student.

    // Input:
    // The first line of the input is the marks of the five subjects mentioned above, respectively.

    // Output:
    // Print the result in 2 decimal places.

    // Sample Input:
    // 75.25, 65, 80, 35.45, 99.50

    // Sample Output:
    // 71.04

    let maths = 75.25;
    let biology = 65;
    let chemistry = 80;
    let physics = 35.45;
    let bangla = 99.50;
    let total = maths + biology + chemistry + physics + bangla;
    let average = total / 5;

    console.log(average.toFixed(2));
